# Hinos Action Puzzle Platformer

The player uses chain blades to move around, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies.

The player uses chain blades to pull entities and itself towards each other. Using this method the player can scale walls and swing over gaps.

- The player can use the cast key to throw his blade into the target direction.
- The blade will create an anchor point with any wall or entity the blade collides with and create a constraint between the player and the anchor point.

With the blade the player can:
- Pull himself towards objects/entities.
