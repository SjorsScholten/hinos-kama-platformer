# Case Study: Navigation and Progression in Level Design

- What are ways to guide a player through a game with interconnected levels, as found in metroidvanias and open-world game?

## Principle 1: Hubs and Spokes

A 'Hub' is an area within the game that branches out into several "Spokes" (or branches). The player will circle back through the hub to enter the other branches.

## Principle 2: Locks and keys

"Locks" is a design principle that essentially closes off access to an area until later in the game when the player has found the "key". "Keys" are items or abilities the player can acquire in order to open locks.

Locks have several key aspects:
- **The accessibility** of a lock describes about how the lock can be opened. *Soft-locks* can be opened at any time but have a difficulty ceiling that makes them easier to open later in the game when the player has access to better items, abilities, or skills. *Hard-locks* can only be opened when the player has acquired the necessary key.
- **The agency** of a lock describes about if a lock needs to be opened to progress. *Critical locks* must be opened in order to progress further and reach the end of the game. *Optional locks* are used for side content or to open paths for easier exploration. The agency of a lock can differ depending on the progression of the game and the goal of the player. For the main quest a lock can be optional, but for a side quest the lock is critical.

A designer can map out the accessible areas based on the players current progress-state. From there he can visualize the choices the player can make to open up more areas. A designer could use this to develop the pacing and difficulty of the game.

## Principle 3: Changing an area, in favor of adding a new area
Makes an earlier area feel refreshing. Breaks the concept of size and freedom in a player. Adds value to world building and giving the world a concept of time progression. Make an area more suited for the players current skills and ability.

## Principle 4: Areas with multiple states
Forced state changes and dynamic state changes. Make the player set the state of an area by intention. When and where can the player make changes to the state. A state changes is not limited to changing the area itself, moving an entity between areas or moving a platform between positions can also be counted as a change of state. An area does not have to be limited to one or two states, the more states or ways to make changes are added the more difficult it becomes for the player to make a mental map. Having to change states has an effect on the pacing of the game. If you map the state change to a timed sequence (like a day night cycle), the player will have to wait until the cycle has passed in order to progress. If the player can decide the state of the area at all times, he will decide the pacing.
