# Counter

Some enemies can counter the players cast.

- They are not an anchor point, the blade will bounce of the object.
- They deflect the blade, through physical properties or an attack.
- They grab the blade and perform a counterattack by pulling the player close, performing a lunge attack (pulling themselves towards the player) or performing a swing bash attack (swinging the player).
- The anchor point is charged, stunning and damaging the player.
